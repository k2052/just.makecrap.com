It will never;

- Be perfect
- Match your vision
OR
- Live up to your expectations

You will never find the;

- Perfect Font
- Best Color Palette
- Most flexible language
- Greatest Workflow
or the
- Smoothest Process

SO 

Stop;

- worrying
and 
- obsessing

About;

- decoration
- praise
- attention
and 
- trends 

Focus On;

- creating
- learning
- growing
and
- sharing

What you make. 

Because.

The only way to get better is to make stuff.

Stuff that;

- has the wrong font
- has colors that suck
- were made with the wrong technology
- followed the wrong trend
- is CRAP.

So Just Make Crap.
